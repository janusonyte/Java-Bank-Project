# Java-Bank-Project
Bank Project - contains singleton object, abstract classes, inheritance, File I/O


This Java project was created during a course I took in Java. It shows my knowledge of singleton objects, abstract classes, inherintance, and File input and output. 

The Bank Project has an abstract class called Account, two subclasses called Deposit Account and Credit Account, a Bank class that contains the singleton object, and a MainBank class 
that runs the program. There is a test harness to test the program as well.
